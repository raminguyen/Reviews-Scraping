    "# Scraping Reviews from Trustpilot for Electricity Providers in Ireland\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python script is designed to scrape customer reviews from Trustpilot for specific electricity providers in Ireland, such as Electric Ireland and Bord Gais Energy. The script gathers various details about each review, including the username, total reviews by the user, location, date of the review, content of the review, and the rating given. Here’s an overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Necessary Libraries:**\n",
    "   - `requests` for making HTTP requests to the Trustpilot website.\n",
    "   - `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for parsing HTML content.\n",
    "   - `pandas` for creating and manipulating data in a DataFrame.\n",
    "   - `files` from `google.colab` for downloading the resulting Excel file.\n",
    "   - `datetime` for formatting the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Helper Functions:**\n",
    "   - `soup2list(src, list_, attr=None)`: Extracts text or attribute values from HTML elements and appends them to a list.\n",
    "   - `format_date(date_str)`: Converts the `datetime` attribute from the `time` elements to a more readable date format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining Lists to Store Scraped Data:**\n",
    "   - Several lists (`users`, `userReviewNum`, `ratings`, `locations`, `dates`, `reviews`) are initialized to store the respective details of each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Specifying the Range of Pages to Scrape:**\n",
    "   - Variables `from_page` and `to_page` define the range of pages to scrape reviews from (e.g., pages 1 to 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scraping Reviews:**\n",
    "   - A loop iterates over the specified range of pages.\n",
    "   - For each page, an HTTP GET request is made to the Trustpilot review page for the specified company.\n",
    "   - The HTML content of the page is parsed using `BeautifulSoup`.\n",
    "   - Various details (username, total reviews, location, date, rating, and review content) are extracted using the helper function `soup2list` and appended to the respective lists.\n",
    "   - A sleep interval is added between requests to avoid being throttled by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Ensuring Data Consistency:**\n",
    "   - All lists are extended to have the same length by padding them with empty values if necessary. This ensures that the DataFrame can be created without any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Creating a DataFrame:**\n",
    "   - A pandas DataFrame is created using the scraped data, with columns for each detail (Username, Total reviews, Location, Date, Content, Rating).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Saving and Downloading the Data:**\n",
    "   - The DataFrame is saved as an Excel file (`.xlsx`).\n",
    "   - The Excel file is then downloaded to the local system using `files.download`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script automates the process of collecting and saving customer reviews from Trustpilot, making it easier to analyze feedback for different electricity providers in Ireland.\n"
